                                        User permissions can only be managed by the organisation administrator - at first, this is the person who created the Appointmentor organisation and as users are added, any user can be an administrator.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are three levels of user permissions which you can grant to a user of your Appointmentor organisation:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>An <b>administrator</b> has full access to Appointmentor, all features and can also manage user permissions. This is usually the owner of the organisation.</li>
                                        <li>A <b>standard user</b> has access to Appointmentor and all features but cannot manage user permissions. This is usually the manager of the organisation.</li>
                                        <li>A <b>restricted user</b> has access to those calendars which are assigned to them by an Administrator. They can make and modify bookings in those calendars and access tasks assigned to those resources. A restricted user can search for a customer to add them to a booking, therefore giving them access to the name, phone number and email address of relevant cusotmers. They do not have access to customers tab, admin, marketing or settings.&nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Top tip: if you want to give someone access to a resource's bookings but don't want them to log in to your Appointmentor account, you can connect the resource's Appointmentor calendar to an external calendar e.g. Google or Outlook. Check out this support guide for more details.
                                    </p>

                                        An invite is sent to the user's email address. The user will then follow the link to accept the invite. If the user already has a user account (this could be on a different Appointmentor account), they will be prompted to log in to that account. If they don't yet have a user account, they will create their password.
